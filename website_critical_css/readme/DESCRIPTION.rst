This module can improve the Google PageSpeed score of individual website pages.

In particular, it improves the score for First Contentful Paint (FCP). It does so
by allowing to configure a blob of 'Critical CSS' for each page, which is the only
CSS that will be loaded before first paint. Any other CSS is delayed.
