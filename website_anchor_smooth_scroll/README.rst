=================================
Smooth Scroll for Website Anchors
=================================

This module replaces the default behavior for internal, anchor-only links with 
a smooth scroll.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to follow the standard install process. You 
might also be interested in the module ``website_snippet_anchor``, which lets 
you assign anchors and link to them easily, but it is not required.

Usage
=====

Install and enjoy. Any link whose URL starts with ``#`` followed by one or 
more characters should automatically trigger smooth scroll.
