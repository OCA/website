Website Canonical URL
=====================

This module is a SEO booster that adds a HTML tag in the header that contains a
`canonical URL <https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066>`_ for the
current page, no matter what query it gets, and `rel=next and rel=prev links
<https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2011/09/pagination-with-relnext-and-relprev.html>`_
wherever a pager is found.
