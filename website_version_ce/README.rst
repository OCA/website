===============
Website Version
===============

This module extends the functionality of the website by adding versioning
of pages and A/B testing.

Usage
=====

When viewing a website page that you can modify, you will see a "Version"
menu on the top bar that will let you create different versions of a page
without publishing it.

When saving an edited page, you will have to select between publishing your
changes directly or saving them into a new version that you can publish at
a later date.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Making a new version from another only copies pages that were modified
  in the source version.
  As a side-effect making a new version from master creates a version containing
  a single-page.
* A/B testing only works with Google Analytics right now.
  Work is planned on Mautic and Piwik A/B testing support.

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/website/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
