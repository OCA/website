By default Odoo has two groups: *Restricted Editor*, and *Editor and Designer*.
This module adds an extra group on top of it: `Full Access`.
This group has some additional rights to the aforementioned groups:

* Full access to the website settings (Website > Configuration > Settings)
* Installing and updating themes
* Creating new websites
* Install languages

These rights are (in core Odoo) only accessible for users in the `Administration / Settings` group
which also grants access to critical models e.g. views, users, groups, and system parameters.
