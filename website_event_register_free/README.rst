Register for free website events
================================

This module allows users to register for free events. Without this module, you'd have to install website_event_sale that has a lot of possibly unnecessary dependencies, define tickets for 0 euros and still 'sell' them to users, resulting in sale orders with zero amount and generally a misleading user experience.

Usage
=====

After installation, a registration link will show up for published events with free seats. If you happen to have website_event_sale installed, this link will only show if there are no tickets defined for the event.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* it would be nice if we could define tickets with price zero and free registration then asks which of the free tickets we want to take.
* Move to OCA/event when migrating to v9.
