Customer views for ecommerce
============================

Adds proper customer views to your shop.

It starts as a port of the improvements done on odoo 9 but it gives you more.

Views
-----

The customer has 2 new items in his/her personal menu: `my account` and `my orders`.

The 1st one allows the customer to edit his/her data with a form that validates the inputs and that ease overrides of validation and other stuff.

The second view allows the customer to view his/her orders without having to deal w/ odoo backend.
