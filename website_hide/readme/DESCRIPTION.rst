This module was written to restore the look and feel of Odoo without the ``website`` module while having it installed anyways. The reason you might want that are modules which use the HTML editor bundled with the website addon, but further you don't have any website plans.

Additionally, this module synchronizes the default website's languages with the installed languages, and hides the ``Website admin`` menu in the technical settings group.
