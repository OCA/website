============
Website logo
============

Load a logo image to be used on website only. This allows to use an internal
company logo (for reports) and a different website logo.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* Go to 'Website'.
* In the configuration form of a website there is a 'Logo' label under the Favicon.
* Load a logo image in the logo field.

Usage
=====

This addon supports multi-website. If no logo is defined, a transparent image is
placed, allowing to have no logo in one website, even if "Show logo" option is
set.
