Marginless Gallery Snippet
==========================

This module extends the functionality of the website module to add a new
snippet that forms a marginless gallery and allow you to create a grid of
photos that have no spaces between themselves.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Edit any page in your website.
* Go to *Insert blocks > Features*.
* Drag the *Marginless Gallery* snippet anywhere in your page.
* Choose a fixed height for all your images. This is required to maintain a
  solid layout. Must be a number.
    * If you still do not want the fixed height (maybe because your theme
      applies it), just leave blank and press *Continue*.

To change images, you need to:

* Select any image block in the snippet you just created.
* Go to *Customize > Background* and choose any background you want.
    * Backgrounds will be centered and cover the whole element in any layout.

To change the images height, you need to:

* Select any block inside the snippet you just created.
* Go to the top parent.
* Go to *Customize > Change Images Height*.
* Input a number and press *Continue*.

To avoid trimming the images, you need to:

* Select any block inside the snippet you just created.
* Go to the top parent.
* Go to *Customize > Do not trim images*.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* If you do not set a fixed height to all your images in the snippet, it will
  get an ugly layout. Right now we manually set the height, but whenever
  Bootstrap 4 starts being used in Odoo with its flexbox support, this will not
  be needed anymore.

* Improve it using `Masonry <http://desandro.github.io/masonry/>`_ like the
  `Graphene theme  <https://theme-graphene.odoo.com/page/blocks>`_ does. It
  should allow to set arbitrary heights to images with a beautiful layout.
