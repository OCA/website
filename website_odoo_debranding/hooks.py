    # - XML changes in website are made using 'customize_show=True'
    # - When Odoo is running in testing mode, we disable our changes
    # - When run our test, we enable the changes and test it. (see test file)
    #
    # For the user it has no impact (only more customizable options in the website)
    # For CI/CD avoids problems testing modules that removes/positioning elements
    # that other modules uses in their tests.
