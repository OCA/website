Website Wow
===========

Provides animations for your Odoo website using WowJS, which is powered by *animate.css*.

This is created as a replacement to Odoo's *website_animate* module, which uses proprietary
animations build by Odoo for Odoo. Animate.css is a more widely used framework that is more
efficient, better maintained, and contains significantly more animations.
