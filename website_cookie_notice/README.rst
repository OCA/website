This module adds the cookie notice, according to the `european cookie law
<https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/WEBGUIDE/04.+Cookies>`_,
to your website.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To change the cookie message:

* Go to *Settings > Technical > User Interface > Views*.
* Search for the view called *cookie_message*.
* Change as you wish. Remember that you will probably lose translations then.

* Can also change the message directly from the website using the 'Website Builder'
* Be aware that these changes are by website.


If you are developing a theme for Odoo, remember that this message has the
``cc-cookies`` class. You can style it at will too.

To change the link to the legal page:
* Overwrite the *<a></a>* in the cookie_message_container view

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Before version 8.0.2.0.0 of this module, users had the ability to configure
  the message functionality and appearance from the main company form.

  Now, the message is generated in a view. This means that after upgrading to
  >= 8.0.2.0.0 you will lose your previous customized messages. If you want to
  customize it, please follow steps in the configuration section.

Future plans :

* Add cookie categories and let the user decide to accept/decline those cookies
* Let the website designer define which cookies from which origins belong to which category
* Disable non-required cookies by default and only enable if the user has accepted
* Adapt cookie notice message accordingly
* Set cookies for acceptance of each category
