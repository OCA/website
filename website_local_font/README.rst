This module allows to add local fonts on Odoo website.

By default,Odoo only allows to upload fonts available from Google(fonts.google.com) and
they can be made available locally or from Google's server in addition to the fonts
made available via website theme modules.But there's no option to upload and have local
fonts available across all website themes.

To overcome this limitation, this module has been developed to allow users to upload
proprietary (or custom) fonts in the most widely used font formats - otf,ttf,woff and
woff2 and make it available across all website themes.
