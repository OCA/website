This module allows to add local fonts on Odoo website.

By default,Odoo only allows to upload fonts available from Google(fonts.google.com) and they can be made available locally or from Google's server in addition to the fonts made available via website theme modules.But there's no option to upload and have local fonts available across all website themes.


To overcome this limitation, this module has been developed to allow users to upload proprietary (or custom) fonts in the most widely used font formats - otf,ttf,woff and woff2 and make it available across all website themes.

The fonts can be deleted as well if not needed anymore.
