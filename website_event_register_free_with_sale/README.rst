both kind of registrations: free and paid.

============

This module will be auto-installed when *website_event_register_free* and
*website_event_sale* are both installed.

Usage
=====

You have two options for events:

* Don't put any type of ticket, so the event will be considered as free, and
  the registration screen of *website_event_register_free* module will appear.
  *Warning:* This doesn't work for now due to a bug in Odoo that doesn't allow
  to store max seats available.
* Define ticket types, but let one or some of the tickets with price 0. When
  you go to normal registration screen, the tickets with price will be added
  to shopping cart, and the priceless tickets will be automatically registered.
  If there are no free tickets selected, then normal checkout screen will
  appeared.
