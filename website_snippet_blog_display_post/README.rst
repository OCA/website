============================ 
Display blog post on website
============================

Offers a widget to display and select a blog entry on your website.
The snippet allows several selection options such as:
* Visualize latest blog entry 
* Visualize the N-th blog entry
* Visualize one specific fixed entry


Configuration
=============

This widget requires the website_blog_more_post_types module.
It also requires website_parametric_snippets a module that provides the 
t-ignore-branding field to allow parametric behaviour in snippet selections.
Website_blog_more_post_types extends blog posts by giving them also a "teaser",
which is what the snippet shows on the page.


Select "Blog Entry" from the content widgets, then in the widget options 
you will find a menu to choose the blog post you want to visualize.


Credits
=======
Thanks to Holger Brunn for the clever t-ignore-branding/parametric template idea.
