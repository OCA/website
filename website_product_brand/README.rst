Website Product Brand
==================================

Description
-----------

This module was written to extend the functionality of product filtering on website.
It will allow you to filter product based on its brand.

This Module depends on product_brand module :
->https://github.com/OCA/product-attribute/tree/8.0/product_brand

While shopping online, we have seen various eShops having a feature to shop by brands
which ODOO does not yet provide officially.Website Product Brand fills the gap at certain
extent and by providing basic search by brands, thus reducing end-userâ€™s efforts in 
searching the products he/she wants to purchase.

Usage
------------

To use this module, you need to:

- Create Product brand, to create product brand
    go to:
        sales>products>product brands
- Select Product brand in product.

Based on this configuration, you will see the menuitem shop by brand under shop menu.
It will show all the brands and once you select that brand it will show product's which
is related to this brand.
