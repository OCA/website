This module was written to add a checkbox to contact us form for user privacy
policy validation

Privacy policy is provided by Website legal page addon (website_legal_page)

This module is deprecated, as you can get the same effect using
`website_form_require_legal`, which allows to insert the explicit consent to any form,
including the contact us one.
