=======================
Upload video on website
=======================

This module adds a "Upload video" option to the "Select a Media / Video" 
dialog. It uploads the video to the filesystem of the Odoo server so 
enough diskspace is requisite. This is useful when your Odoo client 
is located inside an intranet and therefore doesn't have a connection 
to the internet.

Usage
=====

On website:

* click "Edit" button;
* click add image button;
* click "Video" tab;
* click "Upload a video from your computer";
* click "Save" button.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* No video preview
* Option autoplay is not implemented
