This module allows to use reCAPTCHA v2 on website forms.

It is a helper module that only provides the widget and the validation logic
which can be used by other modules to actually display it on website forms and
check whether the user entry is valid.

This module originally comes from ``website_recaptcha_reloaded`` from Tech
Receptives, which itself comes from ``website_recaptcha`` from Elico Corp.
