First you want to configure a target:

#. Go to `Website` > `A/B Testing` > `Targets`;
#. click `Create`;
#. choose a name for your target e.g. 'More Sales' or 'More Members';
#. configure the triggers (triggers generate conversions e.g. when a certain page is visited or when a visitor bought a product from the webshop);
#. click `Save`.

Now we want to create different variants of our pages so we can potentially increase our conversion rate:

* Go to the website editor;
* go to your landing page;
* on the top right click on `A/B Testing` and `New Variant` to create a different version of the page;
* when you're done making variants make sure to enable A/B testing for the page by clicking the toggle in the `A/B Testing` menu

When your test has ran for some time we can find out which variant is best.
To find out which variant has lead to the most conversions, you can either
go to `Website` > `A/B Testing` > `Conversions` or click the `Statistics` button on the Target form.
