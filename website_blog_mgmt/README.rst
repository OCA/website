Website blog management
=======================

This module was written to extend the functionality of blog.post to support a publication date
and allow you to better control the order in which posts are listed in
the web site when clicking on the menu 'News'. The same order is used in the navigation between posts.

The publication date is filled when a post is published. It's also possible to
specify a specific value in the back-end. If the specified date is in the past,
the post is set to published, if the date is in the future the post will be
automatically published at the given date by a scheduled task.
