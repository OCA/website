Website CRM Contact Mandatory Phone Number
==========================================
This module set as required the phone number in the form of the "Contact Us" page.

8th September 2014: As the way website_crm controller is build, there is no easy way to
set a field as required in the controller. Because of that, the method had to be copied, breaking
the link with any update that would be done on this part of code.
A post has been created on help.odoo.ca to follow up the case:
https://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1/question/8-0-website-crm-required-field-in-contact-form-62184

For now, instead of overcharging the field in the controller, the field is set as required in the
 view. It is weak as the behaviour won't be the same if the field is called from another view.
