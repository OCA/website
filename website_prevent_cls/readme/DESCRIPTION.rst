This module can improve the Google PageSpeed score of individual website pages.

In particular, it improves the score for Cumulative Layout Shift(CLS) by adding
the width and height to the images in the page.

It also provides quick access to adjust the Width/height instead of using the
default optimize option when uploading an image.
