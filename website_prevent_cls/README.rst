This module can improve the Google PageSpeed score of individual website pages.

In particular, it improves the score for Cumulative Layout Shift(CLS) by adding
the width and height to the images in the page.

It also provides quick access to adjust the Width/height instead of using the
default optimize option when uploading an image.

Usage
=====

To use this module:

  * By default, it will add the selected width/height when uploading a new image
  * When editing the image, in the Description pop-up, there's a provision to
    adjust the size.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

  * This does not add width/height for images that were already uploaded. These would either have to be reuploaded, or a migration script is needed.
