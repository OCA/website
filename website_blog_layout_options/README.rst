======================================
Layout Options and Extensions for Blog
======================================


* Adds 2 extra display types of posts to the post list of any blog:

    * Teaser: The title of the post with a small teaser and a "read more" link.
    * Complete: The complete post in the post list

* Blog posts can have thumbnails 

The blogs can have a thumbnail, and the user can choose thumbnail size
A thumbnail will be seen in the blog teaser and in the upper left corner of
the blogpost itself.
The thumbnail size can vary from small (64px wide) to gigantic (320px wide),
the size of the thumbail will be the same for all blogposts.
Some blogposts may have thumbnails other may have none (ala wordpress style).

* Blogposts can have different size header images

For every blogpost , allows to choose if the user wants the "Giant image"
at the top of the blog post, or just a plain text blogpost
with the title as top element.

The default (with or without image) can be chosen when creating a blog.
The user can override the default on the single blog post.

In the same blog the user can mix posts with the large header
image and without.

* Blogposts now have categories, and there is a filter to see a category

  Categories are not tags, they are another form of classification possible 
  for the blog posts.

  A widget is available to show the category list in the right column.
