To configure the shown breadcrumbs, you need to:

#. Enable developer mode.
#. Go to Website Admin > Configuration > Menus.
#. Remove the website grouping from the filter if it is set.
#. Edit any menu there.

Keep in mind that:

* This module will try to match **exactly** the URL in the menu item with the
  one you are browsing.
* If it finds no match, breadcrumbs will not be shown.
* If it finds several matches, only the first one will be used.
* Using more than 1 submenu for the website top menu will probably make it
  unusable. In case you need that granularity, you will have to create a
  separate top menu for managing your breadcrumbs.
* Breadcrumbs use the menu name, **not the page name**, except for the top menu
  item, which will appear as *Home* and point to ``/`` unless you specify an
  URL for it.
