This module allows you to have breadcrumbs in any page of your website.
But if an URL is not present in a menu (as indicated in the Configuration
section), no breadcrumbs will display.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure the shown breadcrumbs, you need to:

#. Enable developer mode.
#. Go to Website Admin > Configuration > Menus.
#. Remove the website grouping from the filter if it is set.
#. Edit any menu there.

Keep in mind that:

* This module will try to match **exactly** the URL in the menu item with the
  one you are browsing.
* If it finds no match, breadcrumbs will not be shown.
* If it finds several matches, only the first one will be used.
* Using more than 1 submenu for the website top menu will probably make it
  unusable. In case you need that granularity, you will have to create a
  separate top menu for managing your breadcrumbs.
* Breadcrumbs use the menu name, **not the page name**, except for the top menu
  item, which will appear as *Home* and point to ``/`` unless you specify an
  URL for it.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Log in.
#. Go to your homepage.
#. Go to **Customize** menu.
#. Enable **Breadcrumbs** (it is enabled by default).

* If you want to use this module in a theme but you do not like where it is
  rendered, you can simply disable it in the top menu and add in you own
  layout a ``<t t-call="website_breadcrumb.breadcrumb"/>`` element.
