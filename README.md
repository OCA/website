Page Builder is a Magento extension for creating content by dragging-and-dropping pre-built controls.  We call these controls “content types.” The available content types are shown in Page Builder’s menu:

These content types provide several key features, including:
* Drag-and-drop functionality for content creation.
* Live previews of how the content will look on the storefront.
* Form editors for entering and customizing the content.

For end-users, this means no coding required. For you as a developer, it means you will use content types to customize Page Builder in order to meet the end-user’s needs. There are two ways to customize Page Builder using content types:

* Extend existing content types
* Create new content types

This documentation describes how to do both.
